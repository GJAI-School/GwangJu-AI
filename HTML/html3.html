                It's been a long day without you, my friend<br/>
                And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
                We've come a long way from where we began<br/>
                Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again<br/>
                When I see you again<br/><br/>

                Damn, who knew all the planes we flew<br/>
                Good things we've been through<br/>
                That I'll be standing right here<br/>
                Talking to you about another path I<br/>
                Know we loved to hit the road and laugh<br/>
                But something told me that it wouldn't last<br/>
                Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture<br/>
                Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place<br/><br/>

                How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?<br/>
                Everything I went through you were standing there by my side<br/>
                And now you gonna be with me for the last ride...</p>

                I will always remember<br/>
                The day you kissed my lips<br/>
                Light as a feather<br/>
                And it went just like this<br/>
                No, it's never been better<br/>
                Than the summer of 2002<br/>
                We were only eleven<br/>
                But acting like grownups<br/>
                Like we are in the present<br/>
                Drinking from plastic cups<br/>
                Singing love is forever and ever<br/>
                Well, I guess that was true<br/><br/>
                
                [Pre-Chorus]<br/>
                Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br/>
                On an old Mustang, where we sang<br/>
                Songs with all our childhoods friends<br/>
                And it went like this, say<br/><br/>
                
                [Chorus]<br/>
                Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br/>
                Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br/>
                Better hit me, baby, one more time<br/>
                Paint a picture for you and me<br/>
                Of the days when we were young<br/>
                Singing at the top of both our lungs</p>
        </ul>
